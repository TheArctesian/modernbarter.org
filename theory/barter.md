To derive how the mass perceive the relations of values of commodities, we will use a website. This website will leverage e-commerce apis to fetch modern price data of commodities. User can then query the website to find what amount of commodity A would be needed to trade for commodity B. This would be determined by the ratio of the prices.

If price A is greater then price B

A/B = ratio

For example:

Commodity A a RTX 3090 nividia GPU costs ~$1,500
Commodity B a A paperback copy of Meditations by Marcus Aurelius costs ~$15

1500/15 = 100

This 100 Meditations could be traded for 1 RTX 3090, or Meditations to RTX 3090s has a 100 : 1 ratio.

Before the user see the calculated ratio, they will be promoted with the opportunity to guess, using their rational judgment and perception of markets, what the estimated ratio is. This data will then be used to determine market sentiment.
