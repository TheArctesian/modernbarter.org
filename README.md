# Modern Barter

## Overview

This will be a simple website that converts commodities to other commodities. I will be using our current instrument of value money. I will be using price of goods and comparing them to each other. I plan to use amazon api's but could also go to primary sources for the most accurate MSP and but value does mutate state over time so might not be a good idea. Additionally I believe that, due to China's collectivist economy and state control of exchange rate (very sneaky and immoral but effective for achieving economic hegemony ), the å…ƒ is a more powerful and accurate currency so I do consider using that and chinese apis for this project.

The general concept is `x*k`, where k is an arbitrary scalar value derived by the differences in price is needed to get `y`.

Example:

A temperature control coffee mug costs 150 USD and a traditional coffee mug costs 25 USD. So to trade for it you would need `150/25=6` traditional coffee mugs to get 1 temperature controled mug.



## Brother Ingenius idea 
Before the values are showed the user is prompted with 2 empty boxs to determine how consumers value to see the value of brand then show real price. 

## Trade platform 
Test what amount of x or x+y+z = bigger value

## Theoretical Framework in paper form

## Introduction:

Critically disecting our relationship with money is a pandora's box wrenched open by the growing popularity of crypocurrencies. The most common introductory refrain in any course or video that discusses this topic is "In the past, we had a barter system." This is typically followed by a simplistic analogy about trading apples for bread, or a similar reduction of barter in order to move forward onto their point about the fiat standard we currently live in. Yet this explanation ignores thousands of years of trade and the empires that it was built upon. Ignoring the understudied camel based Saharan trade, the comparatiely banal Silk Road trade, the massive trading empires built by the Srivijaya, Ajuran Sultanate, Ghana Empire and later the Portuguese. While it would be naieve to state these were barter economies, their power came from their ability to barter for goods across their important trade routes. In order to understand how barter impacts our current world, we must look to the past for inspiration. 

A key question that must be asked throughout this paper is why should we care about an antiquated trading system with little baring on our modern world? In answering this, we must look past the status quo we have all implicitly accepted. We are in an age of immense wastefulness. With the introduction of planned obsolescence, popularized in 1954 by Brook Steven's speech at an advertising conference in Minneapolis, as well as the rise of the debt economy we find ourselves in time, we are more wasteful than ever before. In 1960, Vance Packard criticized this trend in his book The Waste Makers, but we have collectively ignored him, and only increased the velocity with which we engage in this practice. For those of us in the younger generation, we are starting to see how this has fundamentally damaged not only our economy, but also our climate. This paper thus seeks to examine how we could better design a combined economy where barter replaces as much waste as possible, with the ultimate goal of achieving a more sustainable relationship with consumerism. This process is already ongoing, with the rise of social media, groups and startups have began popping up with the intent of better enabling the trade of goods between individuals. Some examples include facebook groups such as 'Barter, United Kingdom', 'Barter for a Better Fiji', and a massive increase in free and for sale groups in neighbourhoods across the globe. Some companies working towards this aim include depop, ebay, craigslist, poshmark, threadup and others. 

Thus, we seek to use our platform to better understand how people truly value the items they are trading. The goal behind this is to better analyze the true value of an item, how much of the value is related to branding and what baskets of goods people are most likely to be willing to let go of. As such, In this paper, we will discuss historical precedence for barter economies, how they worked, how our current economy is different, the rising trend of barter in the modern era, what we seek to discover with our website, our methodology for doing so and finally the potential implications of our findings.
