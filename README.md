# Modern Barter

## Overview

This will be a simple website that converts commodities to other commodities. I will be using our current instrument of value money. I will be using price of goods and comparing them to each other. I plan to use amazon api's but could also go to primary sources for the most accurate MSP and but value does mutate state over time so might not be a good idea. Additionally I believe that, due to China's collectivist economy and state control of exchange rate (very sneaky and immoral but effective for achieving economic hegemony ), the å…ƒ is a more powerful and accurate currency so I do consider using that and chinese apis for this project.

The general concept is `x*k`, where k is an arbitrary scalar value derived by the differences in price is needed to get `y`.

Example:

A temperature control coffee mug costs 150 USD and a traditional coffee mug costs 25 USD. So to trade for it you would need `150/25=6` traditional coffee mugs to get 1 temperature controled mug.



## Brother Ingenius idea 
Before the values are showed the user is promted with 2 empty boxs to determine how consumers value to see the value of brand then show real price. 

## Trade platform 
Test what amount of x or x+y+z = bigger value
